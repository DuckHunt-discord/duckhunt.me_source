All commands are written with the universal `dh!` prefix.

Alternatively, you can use the prefix set on your server too, (the default is `!`) which can be changed by server owners.
 
Arguments to the commands listed below are specified with `<>` if they must be specified, and with `[]` otherwise.
Please donâ€™t type the brackets on commands, thanks :)
 
You can pass a player as an argument using his/her User ID, a mention, their nickname, or their username and Discord tag.
   
   
Below, you'll find an overview of general commands for playing DuckHunt (Player Commands)
as well as commands for setting up and managing the DuckHunt bot on your server (Administrator Commands).
 
For further info about specific commands, see the list of [shop items](https://duckhunt.me/shop-items/) or the [bot settings](https://duckhunt.me/bot-settings/).
