### How do I play?

Playing DuckHunt is easy. When a duck (a message sent by the bot looking like `ðŸ¦† < COUAAC`) appears in the channel, use the `dh!bang` command to kill it. You can reload your weapon with `dh!reload` when you have no more bullets in your current clip.

You can also access the shop using `dh!shop [name of the item you want]` to buy objects you'll need in your hunting career. A list of items is available [here](https://duckhunt.me/shop-items)

 

### How do I install the bot?

A detailed walkthrough is available on the [install the bot](https://duckhunt.me/install-duckhunt) page

 

### Can I see the source code?

Sure you can! Head to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3) for it!

 

### I want to self-host DuckHunt/I want my own copy of DuckHunt. How do I do it?

This is clearly not recommended. The official bot is the best choice in 99.9% of the cases. Note that no support will be given for self hosted versions, and you have to update the bot in a timely fashion. However, if you still want to try it, instructions are given on the [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/blob/master/INSTALL.md) repo.

 

### I found a bug! Where should I go?

Congratulations! You can go to our support server to report it, or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues)

 

### I have a feature request/suggestion!

That's not really a question, but you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues) to suggest things!

 

### I love you!

Me too <3

 

### Can I donate to support the development of the bot ?

You can [give me a coffee just here](http://ko-fi.com/duckhunt). Thanks!
