|clover_max_exp|integer|10|Maximum experience bonus given by a clover|
|clover_min_exp|integer|1|Minimum experience bonus given by a clover|
|delete_commands|bool|False|Anti-flood parameter: delete commands from hunters after execution|
|disable_decoys_when_ducks_are_sleeping|bool|True|Make decoys ineffective when ducks are sleeping (see sleeping_ducks_start and sleeping_ducks_stop)|

|exp_won_per_duck_killed|integer|10|Experience points earned by a hunter per killed duck|
|killed_mentions|bool|True|Toggle mentioning people that get shot by other hunters. It can be annoying, so you can disable it here.|
|language|string|en_EN|Language used by the bot. Use the format 2letterslanguagecode_2LETTERSCOUNTRYCODE (fr_FR, hu_HU, en_US...). If the language is not found, this will default to English.|
|mention_in_topscores|bool|False|Mention hunters in the topscores (this does NOT send notifications). It can break the scoreboard with long names.|
|multiplier_miss_chance|float|1|Change the chance to miss on shooting. A lower value will make hunter miss less, a higher value will make hunter miss more.|
|pm_most_messages|bool|False|Send non-essential answers by PM to a hunter (reload, shop...)|
|prefix|string|!|Prefix used by the bot. If DuckHunt commands conflict with another bot, you can change it here. Regardless of this setting, DuckHunt will always react to the prefix dh!|
|randomize_mechanical_ducks|integer|0|3-level parameter. If it's set at 0, a mechanical duck will have a set look. If set to 1, his shout will get randomized. At 2, the mechanical duck will be indistinguishable from a normal one.|

|sleeping_ducks_stop|integer|0|See sleeping_ducks_start. Example : dh!settings set sleeping_ducks_stop 10|
|ducks_chance|integer|100|Probability that a duck that spawns will be a normal duck (this is a weighted probability system)|
|super_ducks_chance|integer|5|Probability that a duck that spawns will be a super duck|
|baby_ducks_chance|integer|2|Probability that a duck that spawns will be a baby duck|
|mother_of_all_ducks_chance|integer|1|Probability that a duck that spawns will be a mother of all ducks|
|super_ducks_exp_multiplier|float|1.1|To get experience earned when a hunter kill a superduck, we use the formula rounded_integer(exp_won_per_duck_killed * super_ducks_exp_multiplier * duck_life)|
|super_ducks_maxlife|integer|7|Maximum life of a super duck|
|super_ducks_minlife|integer|3|Minimum life of a super duck|
|tax_on_user_give|integer|5|Percentage of exp that will be taken as a tax when a player uses the send_exp command. This can be disabled by setting it to 0.|
